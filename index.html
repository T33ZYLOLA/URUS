        <p><h1>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h1>
          The Urus is powered by a twin-turbo V-8 that makes a stout 641 horsepower, burbles deeply when idling, and absolutely howls under full throttle. Permanent all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission conspire with all that power to enable fantastic acceleration. In our testing, the Urus went from rocketed to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds and tore up the quarter-mile in 11.3 seconds at 121 mph. Likewise, Lamborghini estimates a top speed of 190 mph. The Urus feels athletic from behind the wheel, too, with quick steering and stable high-speed cornering. With air springs at all four corners, the Urus has adjustable ride heights based on its various drive modes. Standard carbon-ceramic brakes ensure that the Urus stops as well as it goesâ€”braking from 70 mph to a stop in 149 feet.</p>

<p><h1> Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG</h1>
  Those wealthy enough to afford a Urus likely don't care about fuel economy, but Lamborghini's heaviest model sure likes to drink. The EPA estimates that the Urus will deliver 12 mpg in the city and 17 mpg on the highway. While we haven't tested its real-world mpg on our 200-mile highway fuel-economy route, its mileage will certainly vary based on driving style. For more information about the Urus's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.

       <p><h1>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</h1>
        Inside, occupants are treated to a dramatic cabin that's classic Lambo. Jet-fighter design cues abound, with the start button hiding beneath a red flip cover and the shifter looking like a jet's throttle. To the left of the shifter are levers that control the drive modes and allow customizable performance settings. There is plenty of faux-suede and carbon-fiber trim, while the infotainment system and reconfigurable gauges are straight out of an Audi. The back seat has good passenger space and can fit between two and three people depending on which seating configuration is selected. Interior cubby storage is highlighted by useful door pockets and a bin behind the floating center stack. The Urus also offers up to 22 cubic feet in its cargo area but that drops by 2 cubes with the optional rear bucket seats.</p>
